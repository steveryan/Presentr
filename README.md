# Presentr

Presentr allows you to present your markdown slides hosted on gist.github.com to anyone, anywhere without setting up any screen-sharing.

Once you've entered the gist id of your presentation, you'll see your slides, and can naviate forward and backwards with the "<" and ">" buttons as well as the left and right arrows on your keyboard. 

You'll also get a url to send to your audience members.
